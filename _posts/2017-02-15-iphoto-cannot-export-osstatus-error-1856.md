Buy a Mac they said. They just work&#8230;

And of course the one time you need to make a slideshow or export an iMovie nothing works. I searched the web high and low for this solution. If you are having trouble exporting from iPhoto or iMovie try this:

  1. Restart your Mac into safe mode by holding shift while it boots.
  2. Restart back into normal mode.
  3. Export from iPhoto/iMovie.
