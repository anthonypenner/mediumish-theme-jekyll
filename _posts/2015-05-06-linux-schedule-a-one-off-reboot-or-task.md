So the server requires a reboot because you updated the kernel but clients are using it and you don&#8217;t work at 1:00am? Not a problem&#8230;

<pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint prettyprinted"><span class="pln">echo </span><span class="str">"/sbin/shutdown -r now"</span> <span class="pun">|</span><span class="pln">at </span><span class="lit">01</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="lit">00</span><span class="pln"> tomorrow</span></pre>

You can also the check the queued jobs with:

<pre class="wp-code-highlight prettyprint prettyprinted"><span class="pln">atq

job 15 at Wed May Â 6 04:00:00 2015
</span></pre>

And you can cancel the job like so:

<pre class="alt2">at -r jobid</pre>

Or you can delete all jobs with:

<pre class="alt2">atrm $(atq | cut -f1)</pre>
